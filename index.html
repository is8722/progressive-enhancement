    <p>In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itsel is neitherbut a potential in permanent development.
    <ul>In life, there are 4 types of people.

        <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz
            opinion
            from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing
            as
            an
            issue.<br />
            Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
            Nothing
            exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
            changes.
            That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
            translate
            the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
            Therefore,
            if
            we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.<br />
            They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
            that
            grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person
            is
            the
            same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world,
            it’s
            that
            you passively do it anyway.</p>

            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <br />
            <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The
            farmer said, <br />
            <q class=farmer>Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag> ? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> ? I don't
                know.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
            everybody came back and said, <br />
            <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The
            farmer again said, <br />
            <q class="farmer">Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag> ? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> ? I don't
                know.</q> <br />
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <br />
            <q class=villagers>Oh dear, that’s too <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> ,</q> and the farmer responded, <br />
            <q class=farmer>Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag> ? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> ? I don't
                know.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
            rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <br />
            <q class=villagers>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<br />
            <q class=farmer> Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag> ? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> ? I don't
                know.</q><br />
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag attribute="good">good</tag> or <tag attribute="bad">bad
            </tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will
            be the consequences of <tag attribute="good">good</tag> fortune.<br />

        <p><tag attribute="good">good</tag>  and <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>  are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag attribute="good">good</tag>  for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag attribute="good">good</tag>  for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
